## Method

1. Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
   Add the chopped onions and most of the spring onions and fry for 6-8 minutes, until soft but not golden.
2. Scatter in the potatoes and fry for 4 minutes, to soften a little.
3. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil.
4. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes.
5. Season to taste, then tip in the sweetcorn and pour in the milk.
6. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the corn is tender.
7. Blend and divide into bowls.
8. Scatter the chives and remaining spring onions to finish.
