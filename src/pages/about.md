This site is a compendium of recipes, some of which I have found, and some of which I have created.
I've tried to include dietary information where possible, however:
**IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY** or other dietry restriction,
**CHECK THE INGREDIENTS LIST FOR ANYTHING YOU MAY BE SENSITIVE TO**.

I have made all the recipes on this site, and they are recorded as I make them.
This means they might change over time as I tweak the recipe.
I know that not everyone finds "new and improved" recipes to be an improvement,
so if you find a recipe you like, I encourage you to make a copy in your own recipe book.

Most of the recipes on this site have [tags](/t).
These function like the categories you might find in a traditional recipe book
(e.g. [Soups](/t/soup) or [Main Courses](/t/main-course)).
This is also where you can find dietary information.
